h1. About Analog Clock Project
An example project using the Sprites class I created in C++ to make it easier to work with bitmap images. This example feature a fully functional analog clock, which should provide you with a good example of how to use the `Sprite` and `ImageLoader` classes.

h1. How to run
Run the following commands in the terminal if you are running Ubuntu or Debian. If you are on a Mac or Windows please google how to install Glut on your system.
@sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev@

For newer versions of ubuntu (>= 11.10) run the following:
@sudo apt-get install binutils-gold@

Next if build was successful run:
@./Debug/AnalogClock@

This should open up the clock.

Enjoy :).
